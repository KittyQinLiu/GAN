Generative adverserial model (GAN)
Implemented a discrimitive-generative convolutional neural networks, using python and package keras. On mnist hand-written digits dataset, successfully generated simulated data, looks 80% like real hand-written digits.
KerasGAN_mnist.ipynb demos code and results.

Thoughts: needs careful tuning of hyperparameters to make the network converge.
